# Hourfy ⏱️💸

**Hourfy helps people think differently about spending money.**

Instead of asking *“Can I afford this?”*, Hourfy asks a better question:

> **“How many hours of my life does this cost?”**

By converting prices into hours of work, Hourfy gives users a simple but powerful way to make more intentional spending decisions.

## ✨ What Hourfy Does

- Converts an item’s price into **hours and minutes of work**
- Supports **hourly rate or annual salary**
- Optional **after-tax estimation**
- Shows **workday equivalents** (e.g. 7.6h day)
- Saves preferences locally (no accounts, no tracking)
- Designed to be **fast, minimal, and mobile-first**

No judgement. No budgeting spreadsheets.  
Just a clearer way to think about value.

## 🧠 Why Hourfy Exists

Hourfy is inspired by a simple habit used by frugal, high-intentional spenders:
> *If something costs 5 hours of work, is it really worth it?*

That mental shift often changes the decision instantly.

Hourfy turns that habit into a clean, modern web app.
